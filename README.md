# ML-Applications-for-the-Gym
A personal work-in-progress project that focuses on providing realistic goals for weightlifting progression(Max PRs, sets, etc).

Will incorporate time series analysis based on calorie consumption, processed vs unprocessed foods, macros(proteins/fats/carbs), exercises(reps, sets, and weights), amount of sleep, supplements(whey,casein,creatine monohydrate), etc.
